# [WIP] Box86 Setup

Here you have what is usually needed to add support to a ARM or ARM64 system
for running x86 (32 bit) executables.

Keep in mind that, in order for running a x86 binary, you need to install
its dependencies, but for armhf architecture, instead of the i386 ones.

Because that, you have to install the package manually (because, if you use
'apt install' method, APT will install the i386 dependencies instead of
the armhf ones).
